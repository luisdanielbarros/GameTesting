An unfinished game I made from scratch in Java back in 2017 because I was curious on how to program one. In the game one can walk around a village, talk to loaded NPCs and warp to different maps, I stopped making it at the point where I should have created the second map (to not warp into a black void of instant crash at the entering of a house), I stopped out of boredom.

I learned the logistics of it: how to play with the state for different game modes (such as OverWorld, Paused, Interacting, Inventory, Battling), use class abstraction and hierarchy (maybe I abstracted too much), enumerators and all the other object-oriented programming stuffies.

One could probably rebuild it again from these files, so go ahead! All doors lead to instant black death, you have lots of NPCs to talk to, three even, and the absolute freedom of having no goals at all.
